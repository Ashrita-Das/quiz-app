### What I learned
* I made use of the useEffect() hook, to put API data into state and deal with side effects and the useState() hook, to update state objects with nested arrays of objects
* I used conditional rendering to conditionally display the homepage/quiz page as well as the buttons.
* The app is made responsive for all devices.
